# List of rules people can follow to determine the legitimacy of information they find online : 

- The timeline of the information. Outdated information and broken links indicate the page is not being maintained.
- consider the site's look. 
- What are the author's credentials? Does he/she have expertise in this field? Is biographical information provided? 
- Consider the publisher's reputation and trustworthiness
- Always check multiple sources to determine credibility of the information. 
- Is the information free of grammatical, spelling, and other typographical errors?
- What is the purpose of the information? Is it to inform or persuade? 
- Beware of bias.
- If you see a lock icon next to a website's address it means the traffic to and from the website is encrypted. It is also verified, which means the company running the site has a certificate proving they own it. If you don't see a lock icon, your connect isn't private and any traffic could be intercepted. 
- Legitimate references and links to other sources can add to a document's credibility . 
- If there is any advertising on the page, is it clearly differentiated from the informational content?
