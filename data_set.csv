There's a new piece from TNR about the stigma of Black political activism, I just wanted to see what the take was from liberals over here.

[https://newrepublic.com/article/166344/myth-radical-black-politics-stymies-progressive-politics](https://newrepublic.com/article/166344/myth-radical-black-politics-stymies-progressive-politics)

1,">Do you think Black politics are treated as radical politics?

Yes. It is a common (and old) tactic that...

1. Paints the Black political activists as extreme, while also...
2. Ignoring the substance of what they say.

If you acknowledge the demands of Martin Luther King, Jr. and his movement, then you might lose the arguments on the merits.

...but, if you just label him a radical communist, then you don't even have to engage with his ideas."
2,"Yes. We treat white, male, CIS, heterosexual, nominally Christian, etc as default and everything else is political."
3,"Any politics that acknowledges America's historic/ongoing stigma towards a group and specifies its priorities in advancement of said group is deemed ""radical"" because it's 'divisive'. Even more so ""black politics"" because the majority of America is White"
4,"Gonna throw this out there: 

1) White nationalist groups absolutely exist. 

2) They absolutely infiltrate other groups in the hopes of falsely portraying minority rights groups as radical or extremist, even when they aren't. 

3) They do this on purpose. 

Can't imagine any of those three statements being difficult to concur with."
5,"Absolutely. They pick up guns and form a militia, and they’ll be labeled a terrorist organization that gets infiltrated and assassinated. 

White men do that for the expressed purpose of fighting the government, and they get news pieces and political conferences."
6,"Whether something is ""political"" or ""extreme"" is defined in terms of distance from the status quo.  The white cis male heterosexual experience is the default in this country, and depending on how deeply you consider it your default, the distance to ""black"" will look like extremist politics.

Now imagine this from the black perspective: your lived experience is extremist politics.  Tell me that doesn't fuck with the idea that you are a first-class citizen in your own country.

But yes, I think lots of the American majority resist things that are different than or perceived as threatening to them."
7,Yes. The same applies to indigenous people in the US. They disrupted the idea of a “unified” American culture. The immigrant assimilation rubric cannot be applied to either group. This requires questioning certain assumptions in ways that make people uncomfortable.
8,Unfortunately I think every of black people is treated as radical by many even when it is just asked to be humanized like white people
9,"I'm about half-way through the article. The beginning seems reasonable and factual.

Then I got to this:

>The perception of defund the police as a radical doctrine might come from its attempt to interrupt what Alex Vitale, author of The End of Policing (one of the books Cruz used as a prop at Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation), called a partisan consensus to “embrace neoliberal austerity politics.”

...and, no. ""The perception of defund the police as a radical doctrine"" come from the lack of support it gets from the voters *including Black voters.*

-----------

The first definition of ""radical"" (as an adjective) that come from [Googling](https://www.google.com/search?channel=cus5&client=firefox-b-1-d&q=radical) the word:

>1. (especially of change or action) relating to or affecting the fundamental nature of something; far-reaching or thorough.

Of course de-funding the police is labeled as radical. Even its advocates consider it ""affecting the fundamental nature"" of our society and government; and part of why they want it is because it is ""far-reaching [and] thorough"".

-----------
-----------

EDIT: I've finished the article.

It can be summed-up as:

* Black politics often gets (inappropriately) labeled  as radical.
* Defunding the police is being labeled as radical.
* The author of the article believes that defunding the police is not radical, though he acknowledges:

>It is true that the slogan does not poll well.

...and...

>...Black Americans do not support the broader message of “defund the police”..."
10,Yes.
11,"Absolutely.  Look at the post-mortem for the George Floyd protest.

1.  They started with a reasonable kick-off
2.  They were largely peaceful
3.  The *Police* were [infinitely](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1YmZeSxpz52qT-10tkCjWOwOGkQqle7Wd1P7ZM1wMW0E/htmlview?pru=AAABcql6DI8*mIHYeMnoj9XWUp3Svb_KZA) worse as counter-protesters, killing multiple people, injuring thousands, and arresting journalists

And yet, the nation was easily and readily gaslit to the idea that evil and violent Black rioters threw a massive tantrum to steal TVs and light fires.  It quickly abandoned the thread of peaceful protests that descended into chaos when prompted with police violence.  

Partially this is because Democrats dropped the issue like hot garbage the instant it faded from the news, and partially it is because the Republicans kept pressing for unneeded apologies and pushing their version of events.  

Now the only story told for at least a year and half is that evil Black people defended a OD'ing rapist, pillaging cities in their greed, and Democrats enabled them.  This story has been out in public minds for longer than the actual story by a factor of 4, at least.

This just goes to show that Democrats will only mainstream Black politics when convenient, but Republicans will scapegoat it every day of the week (and twice on Sundays).  This creates an environment that is all too willing to stigmatize Black activism."
12,"There's a purity spiral issue in progressive activism in general. Like with policing and criminal justice... if you merely support reform and not abolition, you're kind of a loser in activist circles. ""You can't reform a corrupt system."" The people with the most credibility are always the purest, most radical activists."
13,"Yes and...

Super unpopular opinion: If you really only care about the policies and getting stuff done, then just get behind a white man with the same policies.  Imagine if all black liberals had coalesced around Bernie in 2016.  Is it fair?  Of course not.  But I'm more concerned about actually getting stuff done."
14,"Some black politics are radical especially those they are critical of the Democratic Party, a party that literally gave them a voice in the political system. First black women VP, first black women Supreme Court justice. We gave George Floyd his justice, etc. Although more can be done (prison reform), the Democratic Party has done an excellent job."
15,"What are ""black politics""?"
16,Yes. Same with any other kind of “identity politics” that just so happens to never apply to cishet white dudes.
17,"Pardon me, what are, ""black politics?"" 

Black people want equality. They don't vote as a block, you cannot assume they are liberal. Wanting to be equal should not be political and I do not see it that way. The right does. 

Black people want to be equal. Not more than, equal. 

If you think wanting equality is political, that's a you problem."
18,"I think this question unfairly presupposes that ""Black politics"" is a political monolith. I think it makes more sense to categorize political movements by their values and policy goals, rather than ethnicity."
19,"I personally don't think so, but I think the message could be made more diplomatic. I think that they should paint themselves ""in exact terms"" as egalitarian. Far fewer would vocally oppose what markets itself as an egalitarian movement"
20,"The liberal response to Black politics is usually founded by the creation of a large bogeyman. It's backed by people not understanding how to read studies, not understanding the difference between causation and correlation, and quite a lot of confirmation bias. 

One police officer commits second degree murder, suddenly the entire institution is broken. You have 700,000 police officers every single one is suddenly a Nazi. Riots in the street, cities being burned down, people murdering other people at the riots, people planning ambushes on police officers. 

All because people don't understand correlation and causation. The disparities are caused by mental health and poverty, and hard drugs.  Not ""evil"" people wearing badges. Police officers are one of the only forces in society that are reducing these three things. And we have studies to prove that."
21,"It depends on the origin... There are black activists who advocate equality and distance themselves clearly from BLM due to its ""negative impact""."
22,These articles are always interesting because they could could have been written nearly anytime in the last ten years (if not longer) and extremely vague in their discussion.
23,"One of the things is that some people act like ""black politics"" refers to ""radical black politics"", as some sort of attempt at, like, at once both radicalwashing and sanewashing, or in other words, acting like black politics refers to radical black politics and that this is good

Like, defund the police is unpopular crap even among black people, but I've seen some progressives act like opposing defund the police means someone is against black people and black politics. It's like they want to present black people as being more radical than they really are - and then use that to act like actually the radical position isn't that radical because it's just regular ""black politics"" so if you don't support it, it might mean you are racist or at least racially problematic

We can see the same sort of thing used against other older stances too. Like the whole ""people who supported the crime bill were racist and against black politics"" thing despite the crime bill being very popular even among black people, and black political figures having supported it too. And with the whole ""opposition to forced desegregation bussing makes you a segregationist"" thing that was smeared so much on Biden despite forced desegregation bussing having been very unpopular back in the day even among black people. And so on

The truth is, the politics of black people have often leaned left, but not radically so. There's often been a significant willingness to work within the establishment and to push for change but cautiously and slowly rather than adopting every radical stance and pushing for everything all at once. But listening to some people on the left talk, and you might come to think that groups filled with radical Marxist cop killers like the Black Panthers were indicative of general ""black politics"" rather than being a small fringe"
24,"Also he was literally a socialist though, because capitalism is deeply related to white supremacy"
25,"Yes, but it’s obvious why in a nation built by white men with population consisting of 76.3% Whites, so of course it’s going to be. But that’s slowly changing, and forcing change isn’t going to help make things more “equal”. I just don’t think complaining about white men privilege has done any good or made any positive impact. 

“I think the only constant is change, and it’s always slow. Anything that happens overnight is lacking in foundation” - LeVar Burton"
26,"And if one black person does something wrong, it’s the fault of the entire black community."
27,Reagan being anti-gun because of the Black Panthers always kills me
28,"> It is true that the slogan does not poll well.
> 
> 

It's one of the worst slogans we have come up with.  But it fits on a bumper sticker, so there's that.

Try fitting ""repurpose some of the police funding toward social services so that people with different specialties can focus on their core skills"" on a bumper sticker."
29,What I said. Wanting equality is not political. It's human.
30,"As defined by the article, they are issues that typically disproportionately affect Black Americans, and have advocates who are often Black themselves. Those issues may run the gamut from police reform to reparations for systemic discrimination. Obviously those issues don't just affect Black people, but a large portion of Black activists have taken on the burden of advocating for them on behalf of all Americans."
31,"I mean, black people do vote as a block though. Especially black women, they're the most organized group in the country.

I remember there were some pollsters in Alabama that were having trouble finishing up their report because they had 10,000+ surveys completed but still couldn't find a single black person voting Republican. They just had to put a ? on the estimate."
32,"😐 it’s not, but I guess the truth doesn’t matter anymore."
33,"MLK was not a socialist and you should stop trying to hijack his cause. His advocacy was for racial equality and labor groups were often the enemy. He literally led a strike against the unions in Memphis because they wouldn't defend black workers. 

Capitalism does not inherently solve racism but neither does strong labor rights or abolishing class. Because as it turns out, a lot of the working class is racist too. Solving racism means you have to address racist issues, you cannot just laser focus on your class stuff and promise it'll work out cause it fucking doesn't."
34,"I mean, do you not question the wisdom of telling oppressed people that changes are coming slowly and that they need to stop complaining about white male privilege? 

That seems like a good way to spark violence. 

I don’t advocate for that violence, it’s just no shock when it happens under those circumstances"
35,I got to say that in a way this is really insulting to white people. It assumes that they are simple minded fools who can’t look at the world as it is today and adjust for those realities.
36,"Especially because the Black Panthers did loads of community work, but if you don't bother to do any research you'd think they were like the Hell's Angels.

Can't have people realising that government actually can benefit people if it really wanted to, now, can we?"
37,"Taking money from the police is bad policy and politics regardless of how you slogan it out. Giving funds to other stuff is popular but taking funds from the police isn't. Seems like a far better idea to just let swing voters have their cake and eat it too - reform the police, fund other things, but don't take a penny away from the police funding - rather than trying to find some different slogan that makes it slightly less unpopular to take money away from the police"
38,"Why not “Demand Police Accountability” fits on a bumper sticker. At the end of the day that’s the real issue, regardless of race if you frame it that way - most people would be in support."
39,"What's wrong with ""fund social services""?"
40,"Similarly, political ideologies expressed or pursued by black politicians or activists are not ""Black Politics"" either. They're just politics."
41,"Some do, but if you assume a black person is a liberal, they will be quick to tell you that's not a good assumption. 

I know. I made that mistake with my college roommate. She reminds me of that every election year. I was mortified. Also irked she was voting for Regan!"
42,MLK disagreed and he was right. Toward the end of his life he was very involved in anti-capitalist actions because he correctly saw how liberation of marginalized people requires working class solidarity. Liberals don’t like that particular truth very much.
43,Yes it is. Treating brown people as property and building your economy around it is literally 'capitalism' + 'white supremacy'.
44,"Well, given that capitalism has largely, systemically, benefited white folks like myself; I would say there’s room for discussion at least."
45,"He literally said “I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic,” and when he was shot he was at a labor event. 

And any other socialist worth a shit would also oppose unions which don’t accept significant numbers of deeply exploited workers. Much of the working class is racist, and much of the working class is also minorities. Solidarity amongst the working class is the only solution to that disparity and, as MLK saw, the best tool for combatting the power structures which create institutional racism. 

You can’t solve racism by focusing class and ignoring race, but you also can’t do it while ignoring class. Kwame Ture was more explicit than MLK was:

> Racism is not a question of attitude; it's a question of power. Racism gets its power from capitalism. Thus, if you're anti-racist, whether you know it or not, you must be anti-capitalist. The power for racism, the power for sexism, comes from capitalism, not an attitude."
46,"It’s not as clean cut as you think.

47,"> Especially because the Black Panthers did loads of community work

So did the KKK

""Doing a bunch of community work"" doesn't actually make a group good, whether it is a group of white supremacist anti immigrant religiously intolerant folks, or a group of marxist separatists that engaged in various acts of cop killing, extortion, drug dealing, and other criminal activity"

50,"I personally think it's too shallow.  I want to fund them, sure, but I also want to move some of the stuff cops are doing away from cops.  I also want people beyond police to respond to certain situations.

Consider a typical domestic dispute call.  Man & woman arguing, it escalates to violence.  A man (typically) showing up with a gun and a badge and more threats is not the way to de-escalate things.  At best it defers the violence until the guy leaves.

Police have very little training, and don't know much about the law.  They are the party of last resort - when we don't know who to call, we call them, but they are not equipped to manage many situations either."
51,"I don't assume they vote liberal, I assume they vote together and that's it's worth investing in getting their vote because of that. It's way way harder to wrangle Asian people and you're pretty much guaranteed to upset one group while you're making another happy, you know what I mean?"
52,That has not been true since 1864…you have much better arguments to use in your defense
53,"The overwhelming majority of capitalistic countries grew out of slavery, capitalism did not defend it because it was shitty for the domestic economy. The south kept it because they were way more white supremacist than they were capitalistic.

Decisions like banning your workers from learning to read... these weren't made with an economic view in mind. It was because they were fucking racist. And even without capitalism, they'd still be racist."
54,"“In a sense, you could say we’re involved in the class struggle.” – Quote to New York Times reporter, José Igelsias, 1968.

Yeah, now I'm super convinced he was a hardcore comrade."
55,"If I were you I wouldn’t be comparing the Black Panthers to the KKK but don’t listen to me, I’m clearly bad at PR. 

Cops did a lot of black people killing, and they still do. The panthers never did anything to America that America didn’t do to black people, which you could debate the political efficacy of. But scolding them for the severity of their response to white supremacy is stupid. They flauted laws which they correctly concluded were in place to bind them but not protect them."
56,You falling for that propaganda?
57,They do not. Many people who are marginalized don't vote at all. They don't see the point.
58,"“You can’t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can’t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You’re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism.”

-MLK 

I think there’s an argument to be had that capitalism sustains white supremacy here and that white supremacy also is fortifying capitalism against challenges to socialize and distribute more of the wealth."
59,"And as we all know, Lincoln waved a wand, pulled a rabbit out of his stovepipe hat, and eliminated all racism and the structures built around it. 

Oh wait no, he got shot and out country never reckoned with how racism is mixed into the concrete of our infrastructure and the amendment that ended slavery includes the word “except” so prisoners (who just *happen* to be disproportionately POC) can still be wantonly exploited. We even have private firms do it now to make it extra obvious."
60,Should tell Mars and Nestle that...
61,"Wealthy White Southerners made decisions that were good for them personally but bad for the greater Souther economy. In the early 1900s, for instance, they continued growing cotton even though the market had bottomed out. Did they just do it to be evil and make Black sharecroppers work harder? No. They made lots of money off of exploiting Black labor growing cotton and nickel and diming their tenants for every little expense in a way they wouldnt have been able to if they were growing wheat. The business model wasn't cotton, it was stealing from Black people. And it let them live comfortably enough that they never needed to grow the economy."
62,"I think you're missing the point here that capitalism favors racism and the ability to treat others like property, and in the case you cannot, you devalue them in other ways. The history of slavery and capitalism grew side-by-side. The legacy of slavery and it's economic impacts still to this day harm black and brown people in America and remain as excuses that allow the exploitation of the poor in general."
63,"“I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic… [Capitalism] started out with a noble and high motive… but like most human systems it fell victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has out-lived its usefulness.” 

“And one day we must ask the question, ‘Why are there forty million poor people in America? And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth.’ When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I’m simply saying that more and more, we’ve got to begin to ask questions about the whole society…“

“We must recognize that we can’t solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power… this means a revolution of values and other things. We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism are all tied together… you can’t really get rid of one without getting rid of the others… the whole structure of American life must be changed. America is a hypocritical nation and [we] must put [our] own house in order.”

“The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism.” 

“I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective – the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed matter: the guaranteed income… The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.” – Where do We Go from Here?, 1967.

“You can’t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can’t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You’re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism.”

There’s no need to strawman and be disingenuous here."
64,"I'm only comparing them in the sense of ""organizations that did community work and volunteering but also did and stood for bad things"". And that comparison appears quite accurate, there's bad extremists of all different sorts"
65,How is that propaganda
66,They do when Obama is on the ticket
67,"I think there still is, but I think there has been much improvement since the 1960’s. There is much more opportunity, and not as many obstacles as there once was except for maybe a racist/biased job recruiter every once in a while. I’d even argue for some companies it’s beneficial to be not white/straight to be hired or promoted to a leadership role if we’re referring to the past few years.

Not to mention the Biden-Harris administration’s policies to diminish the wealth gap - although I think they are mostly for optics."
68,"> The history of slavery and capitalism grew side-by-side.

Unions were segregated in the south. The white unions would only fight for benefits and better equipment for themselves. They let the black workers die and for less pay.

Labor and racism grew up together too. Try to get your head out of the dirt and see the point I'm making as well."
69,"This is literally my goddamn problem. You cut up MLK's speeches to take out literally every mention of race and just keep in the stuff about capitalism.

It is just as bad as when conservatives make their goddamn hackneyed takes about how MLK wants to ignore race.

EVERYTHING MLK DID WAS ABOUT RACE. STOP PULLING THIS BULLSHIT."
70,"And yet it’s eminently clear—in this case as in most cases—that the right wing extremists are a greater threat to marginalized people and more deeply ingrained in the power structures that govern us. Obscuring that fact doesn’t put you on an astute moral high ground, it muddies the reality of who is a threat to us: the radical right. 

You’re not saying outright that the Panthers and the KKK are the same, but you are conflating their historical roles. Even while you protest that you’re not saying they’re the same, you’re thinking of them in the same light: dangerous extremists. Ignoring the reasons for their extremism and their relationship to power is dangerous. Its also something centrists tend to do when it comes to the left and right, which has a lot to do with why liberals are incapable of effectively fighting fascism."
71,You’re comparing the Black Panthers to the KKK
72,"Yes as would I if I saw a woman that reminds me of who I am and whose politics would help me. That's called voting for self interest. White conservatives do it all the time, as do liberals. Your point? 

*I* voted for Obama. My racist father voted for Obama. It was the best choice for many people. Hence the winning of the popular vote. 

If you've  been told, as an American, male, that you could even grow up to be President and it never happens, but one day it does? You vote. It sends a strong message to young people. 

Your comment was meant to seem a little racist and offensive. I'm unwilling to participate in civil discussions with someone who made a point that sounded racist. So, we done."
73,The wealth gap hasn’t substantially budged as far as I can see.
74,"When trying to make a point about his opposition to capitalism, they isolated the sections which refer to capitalism. 

Do you really think leftists are trying to convince you that MLK wasn’t concerned with race? He of course was, and that led him to also be concerned with capitalism. 

Fighting racism and fostering working class solidarity are not two options that we can only choose one of; recognizing the role of capitalism in institutional racism doesn’t remove the focus from racism. Fighting racism, in fact, requires class solidarity. That’s what we’re suggesting to you, not that we shouldn’t—or that MLK thought we shouldn’t—focus on the consequences of racism."
75,"You are wrong. He focused heavily on race, cause he and our people were full on second class citizens here. He also focused on capitalism, which was sustaining the undo hardship placed on us. 

He had a “poor peoples campaign” focused on poverty and the issues pertaining to it."
76,"> which has a lot to do with why liberals are incapable of effectively fighting fascism.

They fought fascism better than the communists at least. Remember the ""liberal"" social democrats (who the communists called ""social fascists"") were the ones resisting against the Nazis at around the time that the communists were chanting ""after Hitler, us"" and going out and beating up the liberals in the streets. And it was the communists who were allying with the Nazis with the Molotov Ribbentrop pact, and who were somehow utterly shocked by the Nazi attack on them and who had to rely on the arsenal of democracy to keep them supplied and in the fight

And the radical left, when in power, more resembled fascists themselves than the liberals have done. Just look at China today, for all the communist rule, the country could easily be argued to be pretty fascist and generally horrid in ways that go well beyond the imperfections of the capitalist liberal states

But it's the *liberals* who are wrong here?"
77,"I'm mot saying they are literally equivalent, just that they are both organizations that did plenty of community work and volunteering and such, but that also did and stood for plenty of bad things. The comparison there feels appropriate. One can oppose the Black Panthers without it being due to ""propaganda"""
78,"We've certainly made appreciable social progress since the 1960s though, because of or in spite of our capitalist economic organization."

Remember the ""liberal"" social democrats (who the communists called ""social fascists"") were the ones resisting against the Nazis at around the time that the communists were chanting ""after Hitler, us"" and going out and beating up the liberals in the streets. 

And liberals the sicced the Porto-fascist Freikorps on the communists before letting fascists take over their government. 

Liberals attack communists with guns and fascists with words. A communist Germany would not have fallen to fascism, but liberals preferred that it fall to fascism than communism. You’ll do the same in America. 

> And it was the communists who were allying with the Nazis with the Molotov Ribbentrop pact, and who were somehow utterly shocked by the Nazi attack on them and who had to rely on the arsenal of democracy to keep them supplied and in the fight

I mean fuck Stalin but it’s not like the Soviets were dead weight. 

Plus, Hitler was inspired by *American* institutional racism. America did not go to war against Nazi Germany because liberals had a problem with fervent, violent racism. 

> And the radical left, when in power, more resembled fascists themselves than the liberals have done. Just look at China today, for all the communist rule, the country could easily be argued to be pretty fascist 

Not by someone who understands what fascism is.

Yeah cause it’s not like America has anywhere that people of a particular race are imprisoned and doing heavily exploited labor oh wait"
82,"What bad things did the Black Panthers stand by in your view? That’s fair that people can be opposed without it being due to propaganda, but it also depends on the reasoning"

86,"The separatism/black nationalism stuff (more understandable than white nationalism, but racial nationalism in general is bad). The Marxism (an ideology that killed dozens of millions of people and has never worked out in the real world nearly as well as capitalism).

Doesn't seem like the sort of organization that deserves any respect or positive regard"

89,"MLK did not advocate for those programs to bring down capitalism, he did it because they would help black people. When he fought for a union, it was because it was a black union. If he fought housing insecurity, it was because black people suffer from a lack of home ownership. 

Everyone benefitted from the Civil Rights Act, but he didn't support it for what it would do for Asians and Indians. He. did. it. for. black. people.

So when you hijack these throwaway lines, and I want you to see them in their full context, I'm not goddamn trolling you. I want you to see it outside the lens of some shitty socialist site."
90,How should they have approached their second class citizenship in a country that was actively and passively killing them?
91,In a time where they were full on second class citizens. Makes sense to me considering American history and their place in it.
92,"You think MLK was for black rights exclusively as well??? 

Was the poor peoples campaign, exclusively for black people?"
93,"Peacefully and nonviolently like decent people

It's not like the successes of the civil rights movement were accomplished by extremist separatist Marxist radicals. They were accomplished by reformers who worked within the system and peacefully. That's the way to do it"
94,"Now who the fuck is strawmanning here. I mean what I said in the way that I said it. If you got a problem, then quote it at me."
95,The civil rights movement didn’t win. It just lessened oppression.
96,"Holy shit is that insulting

There’s still a wealth gap between black and white and POC are still more heavily incarcerated than whites. Institutional racism is alive and well precisely because working within a white supremacist system cannot end white supremacy.

I make a point not to tell oppressed people that they’re fighting their oppression to violently, because I recognize the violence represented by the status quo. In my opinion, doing otherwise is deeply disrespectful."
97,"“Everyone benefitted from the CRA, but he didn’t support it for what it would do for Asians and Indians. He did. It. For. Black. People”"
98,"I'd consider that a big win

Feels like some people are unable to be satisfied or take anything as a win other than a total and complete victory (or at least it comes off that way). And I don't think that's healthy at all. It's not good to take a partial victory as a reason to do nothing more, either, but I think it's important to have a balance. If folks on the left will always be unsatisfied and unwilling to celebrate any progress as a genuine win, that mindset seems like the sort that could be especially prone to burnout, as well as coming off as astoundingly joyless and unpleasant to other people on the fence who could otherwise potentially be winnable in terms of agreement and/or getting them involved in activism

If nothing - not even things like the civil rights movement which brought massive positive change - is a win, why bother at all, with activism or even just voting?"
99,There's no alternative to peaceful reform. Violent revolution will simply be defeated
100,"If somebody said MLK was an advocate for Asian people, I’d call that black erasure as well. Wouldn’t you?

Y’all need to stop trying to hijack mlk. That is my only point."
101,"Cause the civil rights movement was “a” win, but their cause didn’t achieve victory. Simple as that. 

“Feel like some people are unable to be satisfied or take anything as a win other there than a total and complete victory”. When the discussion is about equality and having our humanity recognized and our rights defended, less than total and complete victory is a problem, no?"
102,"Yeah, by *you*"
103,"I’d call it that too. But that’s different from what you claiming. And I’m not hijacking MLK. He fought for racial equality, he and the black community together fought for those advances, and he fought for economic justice."
104,"For huge and complicated issues like these, we are *never* going to see any sort of change that just immediately makes everything perfect

It's a long hard fight that will involve lots of incremental change, and it probably won't be solved in our lifetimes or even the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren

But it's hard to look at how things were 100 or 200 years ago, and *not* say we've come a damn long way and done a whole lot of good

There's always going to be problems, but I say every step forward is a win, even if just a small one

Get enough of those smaller wins over the next few centuries and maybe things will actually be ok by then

But if we don't recognize steps forward as wins, it makes it easy to say ""fuck it, why even bother stepping forward then"""
105,"No, by the institutions of a society where the average person is well to the right of me"
106,"You’ll note this thread started cause someone called him a socialist. I agree he fought for economic justice, I just think trying to ascribe that label to him is playing an agenda."
107,"Liberals love to tell oppressed people to ask their oppressors nicely for freedom, because you can somehow simultaneously believe that a system is oppressive while also believing it’s just and democratic. I don’t think that paternalistic attitude is conducive to combatting institutional racism."
108,That’s not enough. We will continue to press for more and continue to have grievances about not having it.
109,"Institutions which you support. You already made it clear that your problem with violent revolution is moral, not strategic."
110,"That’s noted. I’m not calling him a socialist, but I don’t think he supported capitalism as it is. He and his allies achieved an end to many forms of legalized discrimination. But he could see that the racial gaps in quality in life would persist as long as they were rooted in our economic system, which was sabotaged against racial minorities (especially black people) for generations. Without changing capitalism or addressing the financial wealth gap created by not being able to accrue wealth legally for centuries, the gaps in quality of life will go nowhere."
